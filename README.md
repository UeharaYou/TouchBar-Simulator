# TouchBar Simulator

The first (open source) touchbar simulator (that I've seen) to use the new "2nd Generation" APIs. If the other ones out there aren't working for you, this one might.  Even if the others are, this one doesn't suffer the same [bugs the others do](https://github.com/sindresorhus/touch-bar-simulator/issues/61).  

Not to worry though, I'm sure this will get ~~ripped off~~ *ahem* "implemented" into the other apps.
